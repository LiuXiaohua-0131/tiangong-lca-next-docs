# Introduction

TianGong LCA is an open-source LCA data platform built upon the TIDAS (**T**Iangong **DA**ta **S**ystem) data system. The platform offers flexible usage options, allowing users to either access the [**online system**](https://lca.tiangong.earth/) or implement [**local deployment**](/i18n/en/docusaurus-plugin-content-docs/current/deploy/local-deploy.md). TianGong LCA supports multi-team and multi-user collaboration, enabling team members to work together on complex LCA data preparation projects.

The TianGong LCA platform supports the following key functions:

  **Creation**: Build and manage your life cycle inventory (LCI) data using the TianGong LCA platform, including unit processes, flows, and flow properties, ensuring data accuracy and completeness.

  **Reference**: Access and utilize standardized LCI datasets from the TianGong database, ensuring data consistency and traceability.

  **Collaboration**: Leverage the platform's multi-user collaboration features to enable team members to work together on complex LCA projects, facilitating efficient project management and transparent communication.

  **Security**: Protect your sensitive data with advanced encryption technology and access control mechanisms, ensuring data integrity and security.

  **Updates**: Benefit from regular database and methodology updates, ensuring that you are always working with the latest LCA standards and industry best practices.

The TianGong LCA platform provides comprehensive support for your LCA data management and environmental impact assessment, helping you achieve more accurate results in sustainability research.
