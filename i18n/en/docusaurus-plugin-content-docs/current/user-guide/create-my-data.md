To prevent data loss from client exceptions, we recommend first filling in the version number and saving a draft, then re-entering the edit interface to complete other fields. Remember to manually save progress periodically during editing.

## Creating Processes and Models

Processes and models are core components of lifecycle assessment. Users can create and manage processes and models in the "My Data" module. Creating a process refers to creating a "unit process", while "partial termination systems" and "LCI results" exist as models. Models can be used as processes and will appear in both "Models" and "Processes" modules after saving. Below are detailed steps:

### Creating a Process

1. Open data panel: Locate and click "My Data" in the left navigation bar to activate the data management interface.  
2. Navigate to process directory: Select "Processes" in the hierarchical list to jump to "My Data/Processes".  
3. Initialize process framework: Click the "+" create button in the top-right to enter a blank process configuration page.

> Note: LCIA calculated at the process level includes only the process's elementary flows and does not account for impacts from products or waste streams produced by the process. To include product/waste impacts across linked processes, run LCIA at the model level (assemble the related processes into a model and run the assessment there).

>Note:  
Models composed of multiple unit processes can be treated as new comprehensive processes. After creation, models can be used as processes and called in "My Data" > "Processes".

## Creating Contacts

After creating the object, follow prompts to click through and fill in "Contact Information" and "Management Information".

>Notes:  

1. If selecting "Individual" in "Contact Information" > "Category", and the individual belongs to an organization, you can click "Select" in the "Belongs To" section to choose the affiliated team from the data group to establish the relationship.  
2. For updated data, select the previous version in "Management Information" > "Previous Dataset Version".

## Creating Sources

After creating the object, follow prompts to click through and fill in "Source Information" and "Management Information".

>Notes:  

1. Source citations must follow strict academic standards. For example, paper citations should include author, title, journal, number etc. Example: [Liu J., Zhao J., Wei H., et al., Comparative environmental assessment of methanol production technologies: A cradle-to-gate life cycle analysis[J]. Energy Conversion and Management, 2024, 302: 118128.](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0196890424000694#:~:text=This%20article%20compares%20the%20state-of-the-art%20%E2%80%9Cliquid%20sunlight%E2%80%9D%20methanol,traditional%20pathways%20through%20a%20cradle-to-gate%20life%20cycle%20assessment.)  
2. Following format standards, we recommend uploading electronic documents by clicking "Upload" in "Source Information" > "Electronic Document Link" and selecting files from your computer (multiple files allowed).

## Creating Unit Groups and Flow Properties

While the Tiangong Data Platform supports user-created "Unit Groups" and "Flow Properties", please note these custom operations carry high risks that may cause unit conversion errors and lifecycle impact assessment (LCIA) calculation failures. Considering system compatibility and data accuracy, we recommend using these creation functions cautiously and generally advise against creating custom unit groups and flow properties.

### Creating Unit Groups

After creating the object, follow prompts to click through and fill in "Unit Group Information", "Modeling & Validation" and "Management Information". Then:

1. Activate unit management: Select the "Units" tab to display the configuration panel.
2. Create unit: Click the "+" symbol in the top-right to open the unit creation sub-window.
3. Define unit information: Fill in unit name, average value etc. according to prompts.
4. Set quantity values: Configure "Quantity Value" as needed.
5. Save unit: Click "Save" at the bottom to return. Repeat steps 2-5 until all required units are added.
6. Save unit group: Click "Save" at the bottom to complete unit group configuration.

![](./img/unitgroup.png)  

>Note:  
The reference unit is typically the most common unit in the group (e.g. "kg" for mass, "m" for length). After determining the reference unit, enable the "Quantity Value" switch at the bottom of the "Create Unit" page for identification.

### Creating Flow Properties

**Information Entry**  
After creating the object, follow prompts to click through and fill in "Flow Property Information", "Modeling & Validation" and "Management Information".

>Notes:  

1. The selected categories in "Flow Property Classification" ("Technical Properties", "Chemical Composition", "Economic Properties", "Other Properties") should correspond with the unit group categories in "Reference Units" ("Technical Units", "Chemical Composition Units", "Economic Units", "Other Units").  
2. For updated data, select the previous version in "Management Information" > "Previous Dataset Version".
>
>**Due to cross-references during creation, the recommended workflow is: Contacts -> Sources -> Unit Groups -> Flow Properties -> Flows -> Processes -> Models**
