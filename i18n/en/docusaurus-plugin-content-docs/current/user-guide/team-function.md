# Team Functions

Team workspaces centralise shared datasets, enforce permissions, and streamline collaboration. This page explains why teams matter, how to join or create one, and what each role can do.

## Why use teams?

- **Centralised management**: Owners can oversee members, datasets, and review progress in one place.  
- **Permission control**: Assign roles to ensure only authorised people can publish or remove assets.  
- **Efficient collaboration**: Shared “Team Data” keeps everyone aligned on the latest versions.

Open **My Team** in the sidebar to view your workspace. If you are not yet part of a team, you will be prompted to create or join one.

### Join a team

1. Use **Join Team** to search for existing teams and view contact information.  
2. Reach out to the owner or administrator to request an invitation.  
3. Membership is invitation-only; self-enrolment is not supported.

## Invitation workflow

1. **Send invitation**: Owners or admins search for a username and send an invite.

2. **Receive notification**: Invited users see a badge in the message centre; accepting joins them to the team.

3. **Collaborate**: New members gain access to team datasets and can contribute through “My Data → Contribute to team”.

## FAQ

- **Why do contributed processes sometimes miss flow units?**  
  Ensure the underlying flows (not just the processes) are also contributed or shared; otherwise unit definitions remain private.
- **Why didn’t my teammate receive an invitation?**  
  Ask them to verify the message centre. If nothing appears, confirm the account ID and resend the invite.
- **Why can’t I edit datasets directly in Team Data?**  
  Team Data is intentionally read-only to prevent conflicts. Copy the dataset to “My Data”, edit it there, and contribute the updated version back to the team.
