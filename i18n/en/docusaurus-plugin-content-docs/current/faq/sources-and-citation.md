# Sources & Citation FAQ

## How do I guarantee data traceability?

1. **Record the source**: In the Source object, fill in author(s), title, publication, year, and DOI/URL.  
2. **Upload evidence**: Attach reports, questionnaires, lab results, or other supporting files under “Electronic document link”.  
3. **Document versions**: Use the “Management information” section to note version numbers and change summaries.  

See [Create My Data](/en/user-guide/create-my-data#create-source) for the detailed workflow.

## How does the platform help with consistent citation?

- **Structured fields** ensure everyone captures references in the same format.  
- **Team contributions** let members reuse the same source instead of duplicating entries.  
- **Review checks** in [Data Review](/en/user-guide/data-review) flag missing or incomplete references before publication.
