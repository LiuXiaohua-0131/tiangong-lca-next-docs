# Partially Terminated System Modeling

This section should outline the overall system structure composed of three unit processes and briefly explain their integration in the lifecycle model. The corresponding lifecycle model diagram should also show the connection relationships between these three unit processes, reflecting complete material and energy flow paths within the system boundary.
